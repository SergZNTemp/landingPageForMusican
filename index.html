                        request originated in Marketing. When Web sites are being designed, the folks in
                        Marketing often feel like they don’t have much clout. Even though they’re the
                        ones who spend the most time trying to figure out who the site’s audience is and
                        what they want, the designers and developers are the ones with most of the
                        hands-on control over how the site actually gets put together.</p>
